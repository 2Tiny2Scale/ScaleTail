# Mattermost with Tailscale Sidecar Configuration

This Docker Compose configuration sets up [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/platform-overview/) with Tailscale as a sidecar container to securely manage and access your clipboard history over a private Tailscale network. By integrating Tailscale, you can ensure that your Mattermost instance remains private and accessible only to authorized devices on your Tailscale network.

## Mattermost

[Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/platform-overview/) is an open-source, self-hosted collaboration platform for secure team communication and workflow automation, functioning as a secure alternative to Slack. It provides tools for chat, file sharing, and integrations, with an emphasis on data control and security for enterprise use, especially in high-stakes sectors like defense and critical infrastructure. The platform is designed for flexibility and extensibility, allowing for deep customization and integration with other tools and processes to manage complex workflows.

## Configuration Overview

In this setup, the `tailscale-Mattermost` service runs Tailscale, which manages secure networking for the Mattermost service. The `Mattermost` service uses the Tailscale network stack via Docker's `network_mode: service:` configuration. This ensures that Mattermostâ€™s web interface and functionality are only accessible through the Tailscale network (or locally, if preferred), providing enhanced privacy and security for managing your clipboard history.
