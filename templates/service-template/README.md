## Configuration Overview

In this setup, the `tailscale-SERVICE` service runs Tailscale, which manages secure networking for the SERVICE.

This setup ensures that SERVICE's service is only accessible through the Tailscale network (or locally, if preferred), providing an extra layer of security and privacy for your SERVICE.
